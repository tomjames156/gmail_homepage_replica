This is the replica of the gmail landing page built with HTML, CSS, SASS and JavaScript. It has the same features of the website like the dropdown menus, the tables. However, most of the links do not work.

## My process

- I coded the layout (HTML) and added styling (CSS) simultaneously. 
- I made use of SASS to make the styles to make css like creaating buttons faster
- I added the logic using JavaScript

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS CSS preprocessor
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- HTML Tables
- Responsive Web Design
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt about the @mixin @include and @extend directives in SASS when making this project. I made use of them quite frequently to reduce the time spent on writing css.
